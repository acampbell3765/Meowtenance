Site Maintenance 
This is a work-in-progress blog that aims to present hard topics into laymen's terms. Mewdemy will be the main section, which will focus on cat behavior, diet, and their impact as an invasive species.
After Mewdemy is launched fully, I will begin to add other sections of interest. These subjects will include the environment, sustainability, native species, and more.
